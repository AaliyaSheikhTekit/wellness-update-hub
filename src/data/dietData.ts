export const dieticianNotes = `
Notes:
• If you are drinking tea/coffee everyday, then avoid eating anything with it, and have anything else 1 hr before or after it. (restrict to 1 cup a day)
• Chew your meals slowly.
• Do not overeat. Do not eat more than three things in a meal at a time. (eg: roti, dal, 1 sabzi)
• Try to eat green chutney (with curry leaves) with meals (without lemon).
• Do not have milk products with any fruits or vegetables.
• Drink 8-9 glasses of water everyday, and drink water while seated, slowly moving water around in your mouth.
• Incase of bloating - boil 1 pinch of turmeric in water and have it after dinner.
• Do not put tomato/lemon or any sour items in dal / vegetable curries / meals.
• Do not eat immediately after drinking water or any liquid. Do not drink while eating and immediately after eating. Water or any liquid must be had only 1 hr after or before meals.
• Foods to avoid: Sugar, maida, coffee, oily fried foods, soft drinks and preservative foods. Replace sugar with honey and jaggery for 1 month.

Lifestyle related:
• Gargle the mouth with water before sleeping at night.
• Do exercise/yoga for at least 1 hour, followed by sitting in a comfortable seated position.
• Naturopathy does not treat any specific disease, but rather treats the whole body without resorting to drugs or other stimulants and has no side-effects.
• For best results: Believing in the treatment and keeping the mind strong with self control is very important.
