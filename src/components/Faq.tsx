    question: "How is naturopathy different from modern medicine?",
    answer: "Modern medicine primarily focuses on treating symptoms, offering short-term relief for acute conditions and managing chronic diseases with medication, often without addressing the root cause. In contrast, Naturopathy targets the underlying imbalances in the body. Through natural therapies like herbal remedies, proper nutrition, and lifestyle adjustments, it enhances the body's innate ability to heal, providing long-term solutions and promoting overall wellness, all without the side effects associated with conventional treatments."
